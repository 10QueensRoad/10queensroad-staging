This is a demo of the **Markdown** features available through **Jekyll**

This post is internal to the Staging Area and will not be posted to the main blog.

Things like:

1. Numbered lists

+ Bulleted lists

<!--end excerpt-->

The “End Excerpt” tag is useful for implementing a “below the fold” layout.

This is a subheading

We can also include code blocks.

```html
<html>
  <body>
    ‘Sup.
  </body>
</html>
```

…in different languages…

```java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String... args) {
    System.out.println("‘Sup.");
  }
}
```

Try some out!
